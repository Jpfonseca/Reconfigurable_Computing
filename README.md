# Reconfigurable Computing


This repository includes all the work done during the [Reconfigurable Computing course](https://www.ua.pt/uc/2281) at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt) . 



The first lessons VHDL code can be found in **Reconfigurable_Computing/project_name/project_name.srcs/sources_1/new/**  . In some cases, along with the exercise (filename.VHDL), there is a simulation file (filename_tb.VDHL), which has some tests. They can be runned to check wheter the program is working as expected or not.
