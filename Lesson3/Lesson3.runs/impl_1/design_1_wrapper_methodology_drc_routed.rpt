TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.381 ns between design_1_i/maxdivider_0/U0/FSM_B_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and design_1_i/maxdivider_0/U0/FSM_B_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin).

Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
