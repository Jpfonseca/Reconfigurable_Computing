TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.240 ns between ex2_i/maxdivider_0/U0/FSM_A_reg[7]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ex2_i/maxdivider_0/U0/FSM_B_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin).

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
